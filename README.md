This repository doesn't have any code. 
I created it just to host a single poster, entitled "Computer-Assisted Proof of Stability of Traveling Waves in Compressible Gas." 
I gave this poster presentation at the Eleventh IMACS Conference on Nonlinear Waves in Athens, GA, taking place 17-19 April 2019.

When we have finished our results and publish them, I plan to post some of the code here so that anyone can modify or build on it for their own computer-assisted proof.
